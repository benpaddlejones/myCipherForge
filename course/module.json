  "order": 5,
  "description": "Build a complete 5-phase encryption algorithm from scratch. Learn encryption by DOING — you'll write every line of code, test each phase in the REPL, and deploy a Flask web interface to showcase your work.",
  "learning_outcomes": [
    "Set up a professional Git repository with proper licensing and documentation",
    "Understand ASCII encoding and character manipulation with ord() and chr()",
    "Design and implement character substitution ciphers (Phase 1)",
    "Apply transposition techniques to scramble character positions (Phase 2)",
    "Create password-based encryption with variable key-dependent shifts (Phase 3)",
    "Implement noise injection to defeat frequency analysis (Phase 4)",
    "Design your own unique encryption layer (Phase 5 Wild Card)",
    "Build a Flask web application with routes, templates, and forms",
    "Write comprehensive test suites to verify algorithm correctness",
    "Document design decisions and analyze security strengths/weaknesses"
