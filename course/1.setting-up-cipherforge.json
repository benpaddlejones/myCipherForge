This is called **reversibility** \u2014 and you'll test for it constantly in this project."

In your new repository, click **\"Add file\"** \u2192 **\"Create new file\"**\n2. In the filename box, type: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`\n   - This creates both the `.github` folder and the file inside it!\n3.
