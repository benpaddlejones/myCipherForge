# 🔐 CipherForge

**A custom 5-layer encryption algorithm** built as part of Year 9 Digital Technologies.

## About

This project implements a multi-layered encryption system that I designed from scratch. Each layer adds a different type of protection, similar to how real encryption algorithms like AES work.
